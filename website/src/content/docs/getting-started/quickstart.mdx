This guide gets you from zero to your first analysis in under 2 minutes.

<Steps>

1. **Install the package**

   ```bash
   composer require codemetry/laravel
   ```

2. **Run your first analysis**

   ```bash
   php artisan codemetry:analyze --days=7
   ```

3. **View the results**

   You'll see a table showing the mood proxy for each day:

   | Date       | Mood   | Score | Confidence | Top Reasons                |
   |------------|--------|-------|------------|----------------------------|
   | 2024-01-15 | good   | 78    | 0.80       | Low churn; stable patterns |
   | 2024-01-14 | medium | 55    | 0.70       | Elevated scatter           |

</Steps>

That's it! Codemetry analyzed your Git history and produced quality metrics for the last 7 days.

## What Just Happened?

Codemetry:

1. Read your Git log for the specified time range
2. Collected signals: churn, file scatter, follow-up fixes, commit patterns
3. Compared signals against a 56-day baseline (your repo's normal patterns)
4. Computed a score (0-100) and label (bad/medium/good) for each day
5. Identified the top reasons contributing to each day's score

## Next Steps

- [Configure the analysis](/codemetry/configuration/index/) (baseline days, keywords, etc.)
- [Understand the signals](/codemetry/concepts/signals/) being measured
- [Enable AI explanations](/codemetry/ai-engines/index/) for human-readable summaries
