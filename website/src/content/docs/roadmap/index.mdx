### Future Exploration

- **AI Score Adjustment** — Allow AI to suggest score modifications
- **Custom Window Sizes** — Analyze by week, sprint, or custom periods
- **Historical Comparison** — Compare current period to same period last year

## What V1 Doesn't Include

These features were considered but deferred:

### Emotion/Sentiment Analysis

Codemetry explicitly does **not** analyze emotions. The "mood" terminology refers to code health indicators, not developer feelings. This is by design, not a limitation.

### Individual Performance Tracking

While `--author` filtering exists for focused analysis, Codemetry is not designed for performance management. Use it for understanding code patterns, not evaluating people.

### Real-Time Analysis

V1 analyzes historical data. Real-time commit analysis (webhooks, streaming) may come later but isn't the current focus.

### Non-Git Version Control

Codemetry currently supports Git only. SVN, Mercurial, or Perforce support may be considered based on demand.

## Contributing

Interested in contributing to Codemetry's development?

### Ways to Help

1. **Report Issues** — Found a bug or unexpected behavior? Open an issue.
2. **Request Features** — Have an idea? Share it in discussions.
3. **Submit PRs** — Bug fixes and improvements welcome.
4. **Build Providers** — Create and share custom signal providers.
5. **Write Adapters** — Help support more frameworks.

### Development Focus

Current development priorities:
1. Stability and reliability of core features
2. Documentation and examples
3. Community-requested improvements
4. Performance optimization

<Aside type="tip">
  Check the GitHub issues for "good first issue" labels if you're looking to contribute.

## Feedback

Your feedback shapes Codemetry's direction:
- Star the repository to show support
- Open issues for bugs and feature requests
- Join discussions for broader conversations
- Share how you use Codemetry

The roadmap evolves based on real-world usage and community input.
