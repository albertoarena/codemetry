## What Codemetry Does

Codemetry analyzes your Git repository and produces a **metrics-based quality proxy** (bad/medium/good) for each day or time window. It measures signals like code churn, file scatter, follow-up fixes, and commit patterns to estimate development strain and quality risk.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Metrics-Based Signals" icon="chart">
    Measures churn, scatter, follow-up fixes, and commit patterns from your Git history. No guesswork—just data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Baseline Comparison" icon="bars">
    Compares each day against your repository's historical baseline, so "high churn" means high *for your project*.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Follow-Up Fix Detection" icon="warning">
    Detects when files get patched shortly after changes—a strong indicator of quality issues or rushed work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Optional AI Explanations" icon="robot">
    Enable AI-powered summaries that explain your metrics in plain English. Metrics-only payload—no code is ever sent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Laravel-First" icon="puzzle">
    Ships with a Laravel adapter and Artisan command. Extensible architecture for future frameworks.

  <Card title="Privacy-Focused" icon="shield">
    Runs locally. No code uploads. AI is opt-in and receives only aggregated metrics—never raw code or diffs.

## Important: Not Emotion Detection

Codemetry produces a **"mood proxy"**—a quality/strain indicator based on measurable signals. It does **not** infer developer emotions, stress levels, or psychological states.

The terms "good", "medium", and "bad" refer to code quality risk indicators:
- **Good**: Normal activity, low follow-up fix density, stable patterns
- **Medium**: Elevated signals worth monitoring
- **Bad**: High strain indicators—significant churn, many follow-up fixes, scattered changes

Use these signals to identify periods that may need review, not to evaluate individual developers.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Analyze the last 7 days
php artisan codemetry:analyze --days=7

# Output as JSON
php artisan codemetry:analyze --days=7 --format=json

# Filter by author
php artisan codemetry:analyze --days=7 --author="Jane"

# Enable AI explanations (requires API key)
php artisan codemetry:analyze --days=7 --ai=1
```

Sample output:

| Date       | Mood   | Score | Confidence | Top Reasons                          |
|------------|--------|-------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2024-01-15 | good   | 78    | 0.80       | Low churn; stable patterns           |
| 2024-01-14 | medium | 58    | 0.70       | Elevated fix density; scattered files|
| 2024-01-13 | bad    | 35    | 0.75       | High churn p95; multiple reverts     |
